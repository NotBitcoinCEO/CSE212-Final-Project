```python
# Initialize an empty stack
stack = []

# Push three numbers onto the stack
stack.append(3)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(1)

# Pop one number from the stack
stack.pop()

# Push two new numbers onto the stack
stack.append(4)
stack.append(5)

# What is the current top element of the stack?
```
The top element of the stack after the push and pop operations is 5, since it is the last element that was pushed onto the stack and has not been popped off yet.
